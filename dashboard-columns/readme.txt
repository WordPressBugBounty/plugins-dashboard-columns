Easily change the number of dashboard columns from Screen Options.

## Description

The option to change the number of columns of the main WordPress Dashboard was removed in WordPress 3.8 in favor of a more dynamic/responsive approach. For most people, this change is great because it simplifies the UI. But for those who like more control over how their admin dashboard looks like, this feels restrictive.

With the help of Dashboard Columns you can now easily change the number of columns in your admin dashboard. By selecting your preferred layout from the Screen Options menu you can now better customize the look and feel of your widgets. And all that without compromising the responsive UI:

- On large screens you have the option to choose between 1, 2, 3 or 4 columns
- On medium screens you have the option to choose between 1 or 2 columns
- On small screens everything is displayed using 1 column

This plugin doesn't have an options page. Just set it and forget it!
